# So you want to have a Little Printer

Good news! You came to the right place. Just follow these ??? easy steps and you'll be set up in no time* (a fair amount of time, actually.)

# What you'll need

* A thermal printer, ideally a Paperang P1. There are a number of places where you can buy one: Amazon ([US](https://www.amazon.com/PAPERANG-Portable-Language-Wireless-Bluetooth/dp/B07TCJ2TC6/), [UK](https://www.amazon.co.uk/PAPERANG-Wireless-Mobile-Instant-Printer/dp/B078HZK2NV), [DE](https://www.amazon.de/Paperang-Mini-Drucker-Android-Ger%C3%A4te-Druckpapier-gew%C3%B6hnlich/dp/B082PWV57H/)), [Thepaperang](https://thepaperang.com/products/paperang-p1), [Paperangprint](https://paperangprint.com/collections/paperang-printers/products/paperang-p1), [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-paperang-p1.html) and so on. Don't forget to buy a few rolls of paper for it; you can find them in many colors, and sticker paper is especially fun!
* Ideally, a Raspberry Pi with Bluetooth, but we've tested this with a Mac as well, and with some tweaks it will work on any computer with Bluetooth running *nix
* Node.js 10, Python 3.7

# How to get started

We'll assume you have your Paperang. Great! You can already use via its app on your smartphone, but that's not what we'll do.

Connect your Paperang to a power source with a USB cable to prevent drain. It should also keep it turned on. You can communicate with the printer via USB but for now, we'll just use bluetooth.

Pair your Paperang with your computer over Bluetooth and make sure you have Node 10 and Python 3.7 installed.
